// Read about String vs Symbol

puts, print
gets 

puts "Hello World"
puts "Hello"*3 
PI = 3.1415
puts PI 

Arrays
    Negative indexing works like python 
    Dynamically sizeable 
    Outofbound exception does not exist -- returns nil 
    Arrays are mutable
    Hetergeneous 

    Example 
        var1 = []
        puts var1[0] # 0 based indexing 
        arr.sort 
        arr.length 

        locations = ['Pune','Mumbai','Bangalore']
        locations.each do |loc|
            puts loc 
        end 

    a = 1,2,3,4  //becomes array 
    b = 1,2,3,4
    a,b = 1,2,3,4 // more than variable on lhs, more than on rhs...equate by intuition, discard remaining
    c, = 1,2,3,4 // the comma does not let it become array 

Symbols (Similar to strings) 
    If the contents of the object are important, use string 
    If the identity of the object is important, use a symbol 

    Declare using :name 

Hashes 
    Sometimes known as associative arrays, maps or dictionaries
    Index can be strings, regular expressions, and so on 
    sub = {""=>"",""=>""} # accessing is sub[index]

    people = Hash.new 

Inheritance
    Ruby supports single class Inheritance
    Mixins can be used for multiple class inheritance
